This project is a Java Swing implementation of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe, a more complex version of the classic game. In this version, each square of the main Tic Tac Toe grid contains a smaller Tic Tac Toe game.
The goal is to win three smaller games in a row to win the overall game.

Rules:
Each turn, players play in one of the smaller Tic Tac Toe grids.
The square they choose determines which smaller grid their opponent must play in next,
to win a square in the main grid, a player must win the corresponding smaller grid.
The game is won when a player completes three in a row in the main grid, just like in classic Tic Tac Toe.
Feel free to explore the game, and enjoy the strategic challenge :)
